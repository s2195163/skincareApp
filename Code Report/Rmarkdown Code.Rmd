There are 946 items remaining after 192 products were removed, with the majority being masks, moisturisers, and cleansers. Additionally, peelings, serums, and eye care are generally more expensive compared to other products, possibly having more of the components that give its formula its greatness.

# Create a new variable 'brand' by extracting data from 'product_name' based on specific criteria

for (brand in specific_brands) {

```

## Exploratory Data Analysis

```{r}
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
# Calculate the count of each brand
brand_counts <- data %>%
  count(brand) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

# Average price by brand
avg_price_by_brand <- data %>%
  group_by(brand) %>%
  summarise(avg_price = mean(price, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(avg_price))

# Display top 10 brands
top_10_brands <- head(avg_price_by_brand, 10)

# Create a vertical bar chart of the average prices of the top 10 brands
ggplot(top_10_brands, aes(x = reorder(brand, -avg_price), y = avg_price)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "lightblue") +
  labs(title = "Top 10 Brands by Average Price", x = "Brand", y = "Average Price") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

```{r}
# Create the chart: Distribution of product type
chart1 <- ggplot(data, aes(x = product_type)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "lightblue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Product Types", x = "Product Type", y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, vjust = 1))
print(chart1)
```

### Dealing with Outliers
```{r}
# Create the boxplot before removing outliers
boxplot_before <- ggplot(data, aes(y = price)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Boxplot of Price (Before Removing Outliers)", y = "Price") +
  theme_minimal()
print(boxplot_before)

# Calculate the lower and upper bounds for outliers using the IQR method
q1 <- quantile(data$price, 0.25)
q3 <- quantile(data$price, 0.75)
iqr <- q3 - q1
lower_bound <- q1 - 1.5 * iqr
upper_bound <- q3 + 1.5 * iqr

# Remove outliers
data_filtered <- subset(data, price >= lower_bound & price <= upper_bound)

# Create the boxplot after removing outliers
boxplot_after <- ggplot(data_filtered, aes(y = price)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Boxplot of Price (After Removing Outliers)", y = "Price") +
  theme_minimal()
print(boxplot_after)
```

### Analyze Relationship between Variables
```{r}
# Create the contingency table
cont_table <- table(data$brand, data$product_name)

# Perform chi-square test of independence
chi_test <- chisq.test(cont_table)

# Print the test results
print(chi_test)
```

*   The analysis results indicate that there is no meaningful relationship between the variables "Brand" and "Product Name" in the dataset. The p-value obtained from the statistical test is 0.3814, which is higher than the standard significance level of 0.05. Therefore, we do not have enough evidence to disprove the null hypothesis of independence between "Brand" and "Product Name".

*   Based on these findings, we can infer that the brand name distribution across various product names, or vice versa, does not vary noticeably. There does not seem to be a substantial correlation between the brand information derived from the product names and the particular product names themselves.

```{r}
# Create the contingency table
cont_table <- table(data$clean_ingreds, data$product_type)

# Perform chi-square test of independence
chi_test <- chisq.test(cont_table)

# Print the test results
print(chi_test)
```
*   The "Clean Ingreds" and "Product Type" variables in the dataset show a significant correlation with a p-value of 0.0004713, which is below the standard significance level of 0.05.
*   According to the chi-square test, the distribution of "Clean Ingreds" categories changes significantly across the "Product Type" categories, or vice versa. In other words, there is proof that the type of product and the ingredientsÂ are associated.
