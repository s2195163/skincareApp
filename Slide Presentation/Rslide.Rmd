##Deployment
To get feedback from the users, we shared a questionnaire along with the application. They can try to explore the application and use it first and directly answer the questions on their view of our application (scale from 1 to 5) and an open-ended question that enables them to suggest their ideas for improvement of the application.  

</br>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;height:30%;">
  <img src="https://github.com/s2195163/skincareApp/blob/main/Images/4.jpg?raw=true" alt="Image" />
</div>
<center>**User Rating**</center>
</br>
Out of 22 responses we have received, more than half of the respondents (54.5%) rated 5/5 for the app, while the remainder rated min 3 and 4 out of 5 marks.

##Future work and Conclusion

Based on the feedback from end users, there are a few things that we are planning to improve on our application. Some of them are: 

1. To find other datasets that can be used so that we can filter more variables like skin type, skin concern and so on.

2. To add pictures on every product we listed there so the users can see how the products look like.

3. To number the ingredients list so that users will know the ingredients are referring to which product.

4. To beautify the look of our application by inserting nicer background and make it more attractive to users.

5. To convert our application from website to mobile application so that people can use easily on their phone.

</br>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
In conclusion, Skincare Product Recommender could be a beneficial tool for anyone who wants to know specific skin care products based on the product type they are looking for and the brand they prefer within their allocated budget. Our main intention is to aid skincare lovers on their skincare journey and to make it easier for skincare beginners to start somewhere. Not just that, this tool might save our time to do some research on which products we should get as there is an abundance of products sold in the market and it might be hard for us to choose a specific one.
